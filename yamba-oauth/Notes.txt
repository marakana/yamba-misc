Add support for @Mentions
Add status details
Need StatusProvider that supports @Mentions. What is the right way to implement such provider? Contacts or Settings as example?
Fix callback form twitter auth back to the app.
Refresh should update the list
Need Prefs. Should allow for background data, larger font. Make prefs a fragment.
